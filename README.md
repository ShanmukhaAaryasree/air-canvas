# 🎨 Air Canvas – Hand Gesture Based Virtual Drawing Application

Air Canvas is a computer vision–based interactive drawing application that allows users to draw, erase, and select colors **in the air using hand gestures**, without touching the screen. The application uses a webcam to track hand movements in real time and converts finger gestures into drawing actions on a virtual canvas.
